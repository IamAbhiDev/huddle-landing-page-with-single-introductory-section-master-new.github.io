## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to create responsive web designs using CSS Grid. I found out that dividing the layout into different sections, such as header, main content, and footer, is crucial. I also discovered useful functions like `clamp()` for fluid typography and `min()` to ensure elements adapt to different screen sizes. It's important to make web pages accessible to all users, especially those who rely on assistive technologies. This can be achieved by using appropriate heading levels and the `aria-label` attribute to provide text labels for objects that can be read by assistive technologies.

### Continued development

For future projects, I will use functions like `clamp()` and `min()` to make my website responsive. Although I am not completely comfortable with these tools, they are essential for a user-friendly and adaptable website. I will also use CSS Grid to divide my webpage into sections and ensure it looks great on all devices. I still have much to learn about using Grid, but it is an excellent way to achieve my goal.

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) - This chrome extension allowed me to run automated checks to test the accessibility of my website. I found it to be really useful in identifying potential issues and ensuring that my website is easily accessible to all visitors.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) - This icon library proved to be helpful for my website footer. It had many options to choose from and was easy to customize to match my site's design. It made the process much simpler.

I would like to thank [@fernandolapaz](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/fernandolapaz) for uploading the solution for this challenge. I got to learn a lot from his solution, from accessibility to making the webpage fully responsive with best practices and making use of in-built functions in CSS. It was really helpful and informative to see how he approached the problem and implemented the solutions.
